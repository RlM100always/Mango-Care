    <!-- Anthracnose -->
    <section class="pest-section" id="anthracnose">
      <h2>Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Anthracnose is a <strong>fungal disease</strong> and one of the most common mango diseases, especially in 
        humid areas. It causes blight on leaves and flowers and rot on fruits.</p>
      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Small dark spots that enlarge and merge into irregular brown-black lesions; 
          affected leaf tissue may crack and fall out.</li>
        <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Black or brown spots on flower panicles leading to <strong>blossom blight</strong> 
          – flowers turn black, shrivel, and die, preventing fruit set.</li>
        <li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Infection stays latent in green fruit and appears as dark, sunken spots during ripening 
          (often starting near the stem end with a “tear-stain” pattern). Pinkish-orange spore masses may develop on 
          rotted areas.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
      <p>Severe anthracnose can <strong>destroy flower clusters</strong> and result in little or no fruit production 
        during wet seasons. Infected fruits often rot during ripening and have <strong>no market value</strong>, 
        while defoliation weakens trees.</p>
      <h3>Prevention &amp; Management</h3>
      <p>Preventive fungicide sprays are key. Growers use protectant fungicides (e.g. mancozeb or copper) from flowering 
        until harvest, and may apply systemic fungicides at critical times. Orchard hygiene—including removing diseased 
        panicles, mummified fruit, and dead twigs—plus pruning to improve airflow and avoiding overhead irrigation help 
        minimize infection. Post-harvest hot water treatments or fungicide dips (where permitted) can reduce fruit rot 
        and extend shelf life.</p>

    <!-- Bacterial Black Spot -->
    <section class="pest-section" id="bacterial-black-spot">
      <h2>Bacterial Black Spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. mangiferaeindicae)</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Bacterial black spot is a <strong>bacterial disease</strong> that causes distinctive dark lesions on mango 
        foliage, fruit, and stems, often in areas with high rainfall or tree injuries.</p>
      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Irregular <strong>black spots</strong> (often angular with a yellow halo) 
          that may crack and cause defoliation.</li>
        <li><strong>Twigs/Branches:</strong> Black, cracked lesions that can develop into <strong>cankers</strong> 
          and cause tip dieback.</li>
        <li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Small, pitted black spots with <strong>star-shaped cracks</strong>; lesions do not 
          enlarge significantly during ripening.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
      <p>This disease reduces both yield and quality. Infection of blossoms can reduce fruit set, while lesions on leaves 
        and stems weaken tree vigor. Cosmetic damage to fruit often renders them unmarketable.</p>
      <h3>Prevention &amp; Management</h3>
      <p>Integrated management is crucial. Use copper-based fungicide/bactericide sprays during growth flushes, maintain 
        orchard hygiene by pruning and destroying infected tissue, and implement cultural practices to prevent wounds 
        and reduce leaf wetness. Planting resistant varieties and enforcing quarantine measures also help.</p>

    <!-- Mango Malformation Disease (MMD) -->
    <section class="pest-section" id="mmd">
      <h2>Mango Malformation Disease (MMD)</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>MMD is a <strong>fungal disease</strong> caused by various Fusarium species (e.g., <em>Fusarium mangiferae</em>, 
        <em>F. mexicanum</em>, <em>F. sterilihyphosum</em>). It disrupts hormonal balance, resulting in deformed growth 
        of flower clusters and shoots. First detected in Australia in 2007 (Northern Territory), it is one of the major 
        floral diseases of mango worldwide.</p>
      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <p>Affected flowers form compact, thickened, and highly branched panicles with excessive, often sterile, flowers. 
        Shoot buds may appear misshapen with short internodes and small, brittle, curling leaves, sometimes mixed with 
        deformed floral structures.</p>
      <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
      <p>Although MMD usually does not kill the tree, it severely reduces fruit yield by compromising normal 
        flower development. In young plants, infection can cause stunting and render plants unsalable.</p>
      <h3>Prevention &amp; Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusion:</strong> Enforce strict quarantine measures to prevent plant material movement from infected areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Sanitation &amp; Pruning:</strong> Remove malformed inflorescences and shoots 
          (cutting well below visible symptoms) and destroy the prunings.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical &amp; Biological Control:</strong> While no cure exists, protecting pruning wounds with 
          fungicide paints or copper sprays and using systemic fungicides can help reduce spread.</li>
        <li><strong>Resistant Material:</strong> Use certified disease-free plants and consider removing highly 
          susceptible cultivars.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Reporting:</strong> Train staff to identify early symptoms and report suspected 
          cases to agricultural authorities.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Mango Scab -->
    <section class="pest-section" id="scab">
      <h2>Mango Scab (Elsinoë mangiferae)</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Mango scab is a <strong>fungal disease</strong> affecting mango leaves, fruit, and twigs.
        First observed in Australia in the late 1990s, it is more common in coastal humid areas, causing rough, 
        scabby lesions that lower the cosmetic quality of the fruit.</p>
      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaves:</strong> Small, dark brown spots that may become distorted or crinkled.</li>
        <li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Specks that enlarge into raised, corky scabs; multiple lesions can merge causing deformation.</li>
        <li><strong>Twigs:</strong> Oval, grayish-white lesions on young green twigs that can serve as spore sources.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
      <p>Mango scab mainly causes cosmetic damage, reducing the marketability of the fruit. Severe infection may also 
        lead to leaf drop and reduced tree vigor.</p>
      <h3>Prevention &amp; Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fungicide Program:</strong> Apply preventative copper-based or mancozeb sprays during flowering and fruit set.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Practices:</strong> Prune to improve airflow, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove infected material.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Mango Seed Weevil -->
    <section class="pest-section" id="seed-weevil">
      <h2>Mango Seed Weevil (Sternochetus mangiferae)</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The mango seed weevil is a <strong>fruit-infesting beetle</strong> that lays eggs in developing mangoes. 
        Its larvae burrow into the fruit and damage the seed, often going unnoticed externally.</p>
      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <p>Infested mangoes often show tiny holes or blemishes with oozing sap on the skin. When cut open, the seed is 
        found hollowed out or occupied by larval tissue.</p>
      <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
      <p>While fruit flesh may remain intact, damage to the seed limits market access and propagation, 
        causing significant economic impact.</p>
      <h3>Prevention &amp; Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quarantine &amp; Inspection:</strong> Prevent movement of potentially infested fruit and 
          regularly inspect for signs of infestation.</li>
        <li><strong>Orchard Sanitation:</strong> Collect and destroy fallen fruit to disrupt the pest’s life cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical Control:</strong> Use insecticide applications timed to target adult weevils before egg laying.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Red Banded Mango Caterpillar -->
    <section class="pest-section" id="caterpillar">
      <h2>Red Banded Mango Caterpillar (Deanolis sublimbalis)</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The red banded mango caterpillar (RBMC) is an <strong>insect pest</strong> (moth larva) that bores into 
        mango fruits. Not native to most of Australia, it is an exotic threat capable of inflicting serious damage.</p>
      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <p>Initial signs include sap oozing from small entry holes, with dark frass around the area. Internally, 
        the caterpillar tunnels through the fruit and can cause wet rot. The damage often results in premature fruit drop.</p>
      <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
      <p>RBMC can cause yield losses ranging from 10% to over 50% in severe cases by direct fruit damage and 
        by triggering fruit drop. Its presence may also invoke quarantine restrictions affecting export markets.</p>
      <h3>Prevention &amp; Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusion &amp; Early Detection:</strong> Maintain strict fruit movement controls and monitor orchards closely.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Controls:</strong> Ensure proper orchard hygiene by removing infested fruit and debris.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical Controls:</strong> Implement targeted insecticide sprays and utilize pheromone traps to time applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Biological Control:</strong> Encourage natural enemies such as parasitoid wasps to help regulate caterpillar populations.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Mango Gall Midge -->
    <section class="pest-section" id="gall-midge">
      <h2>Mango Gall Midge (Procontarinia spp.)</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Mango gall midges are tiny flies whose larvae cause the formation of galls on mango tissues. In Australia, 
        the mango leaf gall midge (<em>Procontarinia pustulata</em>) is confined to northern regions, 
        though other species may affect flowers and shoots elsewhere.</p>
      <h3>Common Symptoms</h3>
      <p>Galls begin as small reddish spots on new leaves and enlarge into wart-like formations. 
        Heavy infestations can twist or curl leaves, and holes may appear when larvae exit the galls.</p>
      <h3>Agricultural Impact</h3>
      <p>Gall midges weaken trees by defoliation and can reduce photosynthetic capacity, leading to 
        significant yield reductions, especially on young or high-value cultivars.</p>
      <h3>Prevention &amp; Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusion:</strong> Implement quarantine measures and avoid moving infested plant material.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Regularly inspect new flushes for red spots or galls and remove affected leaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Orchard Hygiene:</strong> Destroy heavily infested fallen leaves and prune infected branches.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical Control:</strong> Apply insecticides timed with new flushes or adult emergence to reduce populations.</li>
      </ul>
